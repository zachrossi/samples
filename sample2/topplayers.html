                <h3 id="mc">Magnus Carlsen</h3>
                <p>
                    GM Magnus Carlsen is the reigning world champion for all three time controls (standard, rapid and
                    blitz). In 2009 he became the youngest player in history to reach the 2800-rating threshold, and on
                    April 21, 2014, he reached his peak rating and the highest rating ever at 2889.

                    Carlsen has been the number-one ranked player since 2011 and has been dominating the game ever
                    since. As of February 2020, Carlsen has been on a 120-game undefeated streak in standard time
                    controls, another record for the world champion.

                    His resume is already more than enough to be considered number two on this list of the best players
                    of all time, but Carlsen is only 29 years old and may not have even reached his peak playing
                    strength!

                    Carlsen became the world champion by defeating Anand in 2013 just before turning 23 years old (the
                    second-youngest world champion ever, behind only Kasparov). He has successfully defended his title
                    three times: in 2014 Carlsen won the rematch against Anand, in 2016 he defeated GM Sergey Karjakin
                    and in 2018 he defeated GM Fabiano Caruana.

                    Carlsen himself does not believe he has earned the #1 spot on this list. According to an interview
                    in January 2020, Carlsen states: "Kasparov had 20 years uninterrupted as the world number 1...He
                    must be considered as the best in history. But I feel that time is on my side...I'm not 30 yet. If I
                    were to be considered the best in history at 30, I would have had to start dominating at 10."</p>

            <div class="col-lg">
                <p>GM Magnus Carlsen is the current world chess champion. To many people, he’s the best to ever play the
                    game, although GMs Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any rate, the
                    clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30 years old, Carlsen has already earned a spot at
                    the top.

                    It’s easy to see why. The 13-year-old Norwegian prodigy drew Kasparov and defeated GM Anatoly Karpov
                    at the same event in 2004, one month before he became the second-youngest GM in history. In 2009, he
                    became the youngest player to break the 2800-rating threshold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class player to all-time great. He captured the world
                    number-one ranking in 2011 and still hasn’t let go of it. He won the world title and successfully
                    defended it three times. Additionally, he has won multiple world titles in rapid (twice) and blitz
                    (four times) time controls, achieved the highest rating ever, and racked up several elite tournament
                    wins, including two Norway Chess victories and seven in Wijk aan Zee.

                    The amazing part is it seems like there’s much more ahead for Carlsen. In October 2020 Carlsen's
                    125-game undefeated streak came to an end (he scored 42 wins and 83 draws during this streak),
                    setting yet another world record. If he continues performing the way he has, Carlsen could create
                    something truly legendary. In an era of chess that’s more competitive than ever, he’s far ahead of
                    the opposition.</p>

                <h3 id="fc">Fabiano Caruana</h3>
                <p>
                    The prodigy who broke the record held by Hikaru Nakamura for America's youngest chess grandmaster,
                    Fabiano Caruana has climbed the mountain of chess and reached the summit. This young great master
                    has had a ranking as high as number-two in the world and has won numerous tournaments in his career.
                    In 2018 the American faced Magnus Carlsen at the World Chess Championship in London in 2018, losing
                    in the quick playoffs.
                    Caruana was born on July 30, 1992 in Miami, Florida. His natural grasp for chess was discovered at
                    the age of five in an after-school chess program when he moved to New York. His first chess coach
                    was National Master Bruce Pandolfini, a well-known chess author. Caruana later was coached by GMs
                    Miron Sher and Alexander Chernin.
                    He became a FIDE master in 2002 and an international master in 2006. A year later, at the age of 14
                    years, 11 months, and 20 days, Caruana became the youngest grandmaster in the United States and
                    Italy. Shortly after earning the grandmaster title, he won the Italian Chess Championship, becoming
                    the youngest ever Italian champion.
                    The Italian grandmaster kicked off 2008 by winning the Tata Steel Group C section, earning him a
                    spot in 2009's Group B event. Caruana then made his Olympiad debut in the same year, representing
                    Italy from top board in the Dresden Olympiad. After a 7.5/11 finish, Caruana then won the Italian
                    Championship again, earning back-to-back titles. He finished the year entering the world's top-100
                    players in October with a rating of 2640.
                    In 2009 Caruana won the Tata Steel Group B after beating English grandmaster Nigel Short in the
                    final round. After strong performances in both the Russian Team Championships and the Mitropa Cup,
                    Caruana was nominated to play in the 2009 World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, where he beat Lazaro Bruzon,
                    Lenier Dominguez, and Evgeny Alekseev before losing to Vugar Gashimov.
                    After missing the 2009 Italian Chess Championships to compete in the FIDE World Cup, Caruana won the
                    event twice more in 2010 and 2011, his fourth and final time winning the Italian Championship. By
                    then end of 2011, Caruana had jumped in the world rankings, reaching number 17 in the live rankings,
                    and a rating well over 2700.

                <p>

                    In 2012 Caruana continued to improve. After a second-place tie in the A section of the Tata Steel
                    Tournament, Caruana went on a streak, winning first in the Reykjavik Open, Sigeman and Co. Chess
                    Tournament, and the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting. In the same year, Caruana also finished
                    second in both the Tal Memorial and the Grand Slam Chess Final. By January 2013, Caruana was ranked
                    fifth in the world rankings with a rating of 2781.

                    Caruana spent much of 2013 trying to qualify for the 2014 Candidates tournament through the FIDE
                    Grand Prix. After placing third in Zug, second in Thessaloniki, and winning the circuit in Paris,
                    Caruana had amassed 380 points, narrowly missing an automatic qualification to the Candidates.

                <h3 id="dl">Ding Liren</h3>
                <p>
                    Ding Liren is a Chinese super grandmaster who many people consider to be a primary contender for
                    Magnus Carlsen’s world title. Ding won his first Chinese Chess Championship at the age of 16, making
                    him the youngest to ever do so. In the 2017 and 2019 Chess World Cup, he became the first player in
                    history to reach the finals twice in a row. The latter result means that Ding will play in the 2020
                    Candidates’ Tournament, which decides who will get a shot at the world title.
                    Ding was born in Wenzhou, a city in the southeastern Zhejiang province of China. The city has a rich
                    chess history—it’s also where former Women’s World Chess Champion Zhu Chen is from. When Ding was
                    four years old, his mother took him to a chess club in Wenzhou. He studied chess there and had the
                    same starting coaches that Zhu had, including his first coach, Chen Lixing, who’s famous in the
                    Wenzhou Chess Association.

                <p>

                    
                    Ding was successful in early competitions. As a teenager, he regularly participated in and won a
                    strong tournament for his age groups in the Li Chengzhi Cup. He also competed on a world stage. In
                    November 2003 and November 2004, he tied for first at the U-10 World Youth Championship and U-12
                    World Youth Championship, respectively. Ding finished second on tiebreaks in both events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At 11 years old, Ding competed in the 2004 Chinese Team Championship and scored 1/4 points. The
                    following year, he took part in his first individual Chinese Chess Championship and finished with
                    3.5/7 points. The next time he took part in the prestigious event was in 2008, when he scored 5.5/11
                    points, good for sixth place.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Ding was one of the favorites heading into the 2020 Candidates tournament, but he had a bad start
                    after losing his first two games. On March 26, 2020, the Candidates tournament was postponed due to
                    Russia's travel restrictions and the COVID-19 pandemic. After seven rounds, Ding is tied for 7th/8th
                    place with 2.5/7.
