                <h3>Chess Orgins</h3>
                <p>The origin of chess remains a matter of controversy. There is no credible evidence that chess existed
                    in a form approaching the modern game before the 6th century ce. Game pieces found in Russia, China,
                    India, Central Asia, Pakistan, and elsewhere that have been determined to be older than that are now
                    regarded as coming from earlier distantly related board games, often involving dice and sometimes
                    using playing boards of 100 or more squares.

                </p>
                <p>
                    One of those earlier games was a war game called chaturanga, a Sanskrit name for a battle formation
                    mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Chaturanga was flourishing in northwestern India by the
                    7th century and is regarded as the earliest precursor of modern chess because it had two key
                    features found in all later chess variants—different pieces had different powers (unlike checkers
                    and go), and victory was based on one piece, the king of modern chess.

            <div class="col-lg">
                <p>How chaturanga evolved is unclear. Some historians say chaturanga, perhaps played with dice on a
                    64-square board, gradually transformed into shatranj (or chatrang), a two-player game popular in
                    northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and southern parts of Central Asia after 600 ce. Shatranj
                    resembled chaturanga but added a new piece, a firzān (counselor), which had nothing to do with any
                    troop formation. A game of shatranj could be won either by eliminating all an opponent’s pieces
                    (baring the king) or by ensuring the capture of the king. The initial positions of the pawns and
                    knights have not changed, but there were considerable regional and temporal variations for the other
                    pieces.

                    The game spread to the east, north, and west, taking on sharply different characteristics. In the
                    East, carried by Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders, and others, it was transformed into a game
                    with inscribed disks that were often placed on the intersection of the lines of the board rather
                    than within the squares. About 750 ce chess reached China, and by the 11th century it had come to
                    Japan and Korea. Chinese chess, the most popular version of the Eastern game, has 9 files and 10
                    ranks as well as a boundary—the river, between the 5th and 6th ranks—that limits access to the enemy
                    camp and makes the game slower than its Western cousin.
